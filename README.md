# 🌍 ClimateGuard: Community-Led Micro-Insurance Pools

Welcome to ClimateGuard, a decentralized Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain that empowers communities in climate-vulnerable areas to create and manage micro-insurance pools. By pooling small contributions from participants, the system provides financial protection against climate-related risks like floods, droughts, and storms. Using blockchain transparency, automated smart contracts eliminate intermediaries, reduce fraud, and ensure fair payouts based on verifiable real-world data.

This project solves a real-world problem: In regions prone to climate disasters (e.g., coastal areas in Southeast Asia or drought-hit farms in Africa), traditional insurance is often inaccessible, expensive, or mistrusted due to opaque processes. ClimateGuard enables community-led pools where locals decide rules, contribute affordably, and receive automatic payouts triggered by oracle-verified events—fostering resilience and financial inclusion.

Built with Clarity smart contracts on Stacks for security and scalability.

## ✨ Features

🌱 **Community Governance**: Pools are governed by DAO-style voting, allowing members to set premiums, coverage rules, and claim thresholds.  
💰 **Micro-Contributions**: Users contribute small amounts (e.g., in STX or stablecoins) to join pools, with funds locked in secure treasuries.  
📡 **Oracle Integration**: Real-time climate data from oracles (e.g., weather APIs) triggers automatic payouts without manual reviews.  
⚖️ **Transparent Claims**: Submit and verify claims on-chain, with community or automated approval to prevent abuse.  
🔒 **Risk Pooling**: Funds are pooled and invested conservatively (e.g., in yield-bearing assets) to grow reserves.  
📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: View pool health, risk assessments, and historical payouts via on-chain queries.  
🚫 **Fraud Prevention**: Immutable records and multi-signature approvals ensure trustless operations.  
🌐 **Scalable Pools**: Create region-specific pools for different risks (e.g., flood in one, drought in another).

## 🛠 How It Works

ClimateGuard uses 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to handle everything from pool creation to payouts. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **PoolFactory.clar**: Factory contract for deploying new insurance pools. It creates instances of InsurancePool and links them to other contracts.
2. **InsurancePool.clar**: Core contract per pool, managing member contributions, premium calculations, and overall pool state.
3. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Handles community voting on pool parameters (e.g., premium rates, coverage limits) using token-based governance.
4. **OracleIntegrator.clar**: Interfaces with external oracles to fetch and verify climate event data (e.g., rainfall levels exceeding thresholds).
5. **ClaimManager.clar**: Processes claim submissions, validations, and approvals, integrating with GovernanceDAO for disputes.
6. **TreasuryVault.clar**: Securely holds pooled funds, supports deposits/withdrawals, and integrates with yield protocols if enabled.
7. **RiskAssessor.clar**: Analyzes risk data (from oracles) to dynamically adjust premiums and predict pool solvency.
8. **MembershipToken.clar**: Issues NFT or fungible tokens representing membership, used for voting and claiming benefits.

### For Community Organizers (Pool Creators)
- Deploy a new pool via PoolFactory, specifying risk type (e.g., "flood"), region, and initial parameters.
- Invite members by sharing the pool address—users mint MembershipTokens to join.
- Use GovernanceDAO to propose and vote on changes, like adjusting premiums based on RiskAssessor data.

### For Participants (Contributors)
- Contribute funds to InsurancePool (e.g., via STX transfers).
- Receive MembershipTokens as proof of participation, granting voting rights and claim eligibility.
- Monitor pool via on-chain queries—e.g., check treasury balance with TreasuryVault.

### For Claimants
- When a climate event occurs (e.g., verified flood via OracleIntegrator), submit a claim to ClaimManager with proof (e.g., location data).
- Claims are auto-validated if thresholds met; otherwise, community votes via GovernanceDAO.
- Approved claims trigger automatic payouts from TreasuryVault, distributed proportionally.

### For Verifiers/Auditors
- Query any contract (e.g., get-pool-details from InsurancePool) to view immutable records of contributions, claims, and payouts.
- Use RiskAssessor to simulate scenarios and verify pool sustainability.

Boom! Transparent, automated insurance that builds community resilience against climate change.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Install the Stacks CLI and Clarity tools.
2. Deploy the contracts on Stacks testnet.
3. Interact via the Hiro Wallet or custom frontend.
4. For production, integrate with real oracles like Chainlink on Stacks.
